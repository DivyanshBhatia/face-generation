# face-generation

## Description
In this project we apply DC GAN on MNIST dataset to generate new handwritten digits not already found in dataset and CelebA dataset
where we apply DC GAN to generate new faces using celebrity faces.

The model evaluation is done in terms of generator loss and discriminator loss.
<br/>
The final result can be seen in "final result" cells in html and py notebook file.
<br/>
Also, provided in the files are the results at the other hyperparameter settings
<br/>
The experiment was performed on tensorFlow 1.0 GPU on floydhub
